# [Portfolio for Josh Pollard](https://joshlucpoll.com) *(WIP)*

This repository contains all the code used to produce [https://joshlucpoll.com](https://joshlucpoll.com).  
It was created using [React JS](https://reactjs.org) and hosted with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com)

## Console
Navigation for joshlucpoll.com is achieved with **UNIX** commands - instead of the traditional navigation bar/dropdown. Typing:

    help

into the command line will explain further.

The most used command on the website is:

    cd

which changes the page you are viewing. I have implemented the [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) package to manage this, as well as [CSSTransitions](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/css-transition) and [TransitionGroup](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition-group) from [React Transition Group](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/) for animations.
